# Coswara-Data

Project Coswara by Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore is an attempt to build a diagnostic tool for Covid-19 based on respiratory, cough and speech sounds. The project is in the data collection stage now. It requires the participants to provide a recording of breathing sounds, cough sounds, sustained phonation of vowel sounds and a counting exercise.

This is the data repository for Project Coswara.
